<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

The name of the discord that is being created is called "The Mecca" or in english, The Centre. It is meant to be a place where everyone can come together regardless of their background and enjoy their time together in gaming, life-related things, or general talk. I wanted to get some images that reflect that, and to me a centre is a city-hub-like area.

This was the first banner that came to mind, a literal interpretation of The Mecca as its real life counterpart. However it did not fit the philosopy in mind completely, which its a place for everyone.

So, another image was needed and this was the final choice.
